Breathe
=======

.. note::

   This version of breathe has been hacked for specific usage in the
   XCore XDoc repository. 


This is an extension to restructured text and Sphinx to be able to read and
render the Doxygen xml output.

Status
------

This has passed proof of concept stage and has proved itself to be a useful
tool. It is usable, but will generate a couple of warnings from time to time.

For example usage, please see the `documentation
<http://michaeljones.github.com/breathe>`_.

There are no unittests.

Running Testsuite
-----------------

This process assumes the ``sphinx-build`` script is on your path. If it is not,
then either edit ``testsuite/Makefile`` to point at it or create a link to it in
the ``testsuite`` directory.

First run ``make`` for each folder in the examples directory, then::

   cd testsuite
   make html

Then view the resulting html with your browser of choice.
